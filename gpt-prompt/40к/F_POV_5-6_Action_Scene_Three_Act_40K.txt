Analyze these stories and give me a very detailed prompt (like outline with settings, characters count four each part, with a cliffhangers and re-hook every 3-4k characters that is created by you) to write similar story 40k characters long. Making this story dynamic like a blockbuster movies (but not a lot of events), with a very harsh revenge with, main character turning villian, , with Wife and her associates (lover) losing all (devastating revenge by main character) with an dynamic action scenes, dynamic, suspenseful plot, with fights or chasing and confrontations. 




Husband is underdog. 




Don't put wife in prison it's a cliche. 




Always end story on a high peak action moment, but logically concluded story, no epilogues and aftewards bla bla. 




DON'T inspire Movie like gone, prisoners, john wick etc. NO chen, ramirez, rodriguez, sarah chen, marcus webb in story! with a dirty like gossip detailse (what drama shows people like - dirty details) (no fraud and IRS) also separetely adopt setting for characters from some movie or book to make it more deep. Avoid plot holes! Without murder (and descriptive violence) avoid unrealistic getting of evidence.




Wife cheated MAKE STORY VERY REALISTIC. 




FIRST POV from husband.  With sarcastic jokes, inner commentary, husband smart. Act like stephen king create powerful story.  THREE ACT STRUCTURE.




With physical revenge on lover (scaring him, or slapping or threatening, or ruin his car or his house or smth else) but not violent. Create few layers plot act like top netflix writer with a lot of action scenes. 








Create 5-6 action scene with high retention of readers. - write like a stephen king creating suspense.




Always end story on a high peak action moment, but logically concluded story, no epilogues and aftewards bla bla.

One unexpected but logical twist. Check on logic and timelines to fit it well! 




Adopt part of plot (events (characters and settings, profession) from random stephen king book (modern days always) but with adaptation of wife cheated and husband got revenge 




(Inspire by some interesting event or actions scene from Stephen King books, or Raymond Chandler, Or James Hadley Chase Or Pick Random Best Selling Thriller Detective Writer.
