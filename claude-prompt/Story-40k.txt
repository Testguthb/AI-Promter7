## MANDATORY ELEMENTS:

### OPENING (First 500 characters):
* **POWERFUL HOOK from the very first words** - something shocking that forces readers to continue

* Wife
* Entitled wife's relative
* Ex-friends
* **FORBIDDEN NAMES**: Rodriguez, Marcus Webb, Noah, Chen

### PLOT SEQUENCE (DO NOT CHANGE ORDER):
* Conflict with entitled wife's relative
* Tension escalation
* Loss of friends due to conflict
* **HEATED CONFRONTATION with ex-friends** (mandatory!)
* **Husband's revenge at the end** (realistic and legally logical)
* **Jaw-dropping finale** (NOT a cliffhanger)

### DIALOGUES:
* **Realistic conversations** in American English
* Detailed confrontations
* Emotional arguments
* Minimum 40% of text should be dialogue
* Natural speech patterns and reactions

### STYLE:
* Simple American English
* **SUPER-REALISTIC** (check all logic!)
* No slurs or offensive language
* Realistic timelines and professional details
* Legally plausible actions
* Everything must sound believable

### FINALE:
* **Jaw-dropping moment at the end**
* End with the words "THE END"
* NO open questions or cliffhangers
* Complete resolution
